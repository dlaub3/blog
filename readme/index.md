# README

I build web apps. But it wasn't always this way, I don't have a CS degree or
a technical background. In fact, I knew nothing about programming until I began
to write CSS and understand what websites are made of. Then I got sucked into
the void, the black hole of web development consumed me and I became developer.
It's one of the best things that's ever happened to me.

Opinions are my own.
