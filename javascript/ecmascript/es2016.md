ES2016 was a much smaller update than ES2015. 

## Array.Includes()

[Array.includes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes) returns a boolean value.

```js
const isIncluded = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].includes(6);
console.log(isIncluded);
```

## Exponentiation Operator



The [exponentiation operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators#Exponentiation_(**)) has the same effect as `Math.pow`. 

```js
let x = 2 ** 2;
let y = Math.pow(2, 2);
console.log(x, y);
```
