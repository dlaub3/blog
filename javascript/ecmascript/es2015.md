## Browser support

To see a comprehensive list of support for ES2015 see [https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) 

Because ES2015 isn't fully supported it should be transpiled to ES5. Babel is the most popular transpiler.  For small projects you can link to a Babel transpiler and transpile in the browser. However, this is slow and not recommended for working on large projects or for production. 

ES2015 was a **big** update to JS. 

## `const` and `let` 

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const)

Const and let allow you to define block scoped variables. Scope hoisting allows you to assign a variable before it is declared. But you cannot do this with `const` a and `let ` because of the [temporal dead zone](https://wesbos.com/temporal-dead-zone/). While `var` is hoisted to the top of the scope, `let` and `const` are scoped hoisted to the nearest block.

```javascript
x = 5; // assignment 
console.log(x); //using it
var x; // declairing it

y = 5; // assignment 
console.log(y); //using it
let y; // declairing it

let z = 15;
console.log(z);
if(z > 12) { let z = 5; } // the value of z isn't change globally. 
console.log(z);
```

As you can see ` let` allows you to declare variables that are limited to the statement, block, or expression. 

**Const** creates a read-only reference to a variable but it's <u>not</u> immutable.

```javascript
const dozen = 12; 
const dozen = 13; // will not work 

if (dozen === 12) {
  let dozen = 13; // this will work because JavaScript is block scoped
  console.log(dozen); 
}
console.log(dozen); // dozen is still 12
```

## Template literals 

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)

These are also called template strings or string literals. 

```javascript
const name = "Brad";
const thing = "dog";
`I am a ${thing}, my name is ${name}`;
```

Template literals preserve white space and line breaks. They also allow you to include expressions.

## Tagged Template Literals 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates

```js
function tagTransformer(strings, ...values) {
  let res = "";
  values.forEach((val, i ) => { values[i] = val.toUpperCase()});
  res = strings.reduce((acc, val, i) => {
    return acc + values[i - 1] + val;
  })
  return res + "!";
}

let description = "great";
let kind = "chocolate chip";
let transofrmed = tagTransformer`This is a ${kind} cookie, and it is ${description}`;

console.log(transofrmed);
```

## Arrow functions

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)

[https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/es6-in-depth-arrow-functions/](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/es6-in-depth-arrow-functions/)

```javascript
let add = (a) => { return (b) => (a + b) };
let add5 = add(5);
console.log(add5(15) === 20);
```

Arrow functions do more than provide a cleaner syntax. They also helps the problem of ``` this```.  Arrow functions don't have their own ``` this```.  They inherit ``` this``` from the enclosing scope. However, they may complicate debugging since they have an anonymous stack trace. Arrow functions bind to the scope of where they are defined, not where they are called. This is called lexical binding. 

## Rest and Spread Operators 

> **Spread syntax** allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.
>
> <cite>[Mozilla Spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)</cite>
>
> <cite>[Mizilla Rest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters)</cite>

Below the array is spread as individual arguments in the function call. But in the function definition, all of those arguments are collected into an array. 

```js
function foo(x, ...argz) {
  console.log(`The first argument is: ${x}`);
  argz.forEach((x) => {console.log(x)});
}

let argz = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
foo(...argz);
```

## Default Arguments 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters

```js
function error(m) {
  console.log(m)
}

function foo(arg = error(`You seem to have forgotten something.`)) {
  console.log(`So glad you remebered the arg: ${arg} `);
}

foo();
foo({a: 36});

function bar(options) {
  options = Object.assign({ size: 'large', color: 'blue', speed: 'fast' }, options)
  for (let option in options) {
    console.log(options[option])
  }
}

bar({ size: 'medium' });
```

## Object Initializer Shorthand

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#New_notations_in_ECMAScript_2015

When the variable has the same name as the object property you can use shorthand syntax. 

```js
const name = 'foo', age = 25;
const obj = {name, age};
```

## Object Destructuring

[Mozilla Destructuring Assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

Object destructuring is one of my favorite features of ES2015. 

```js
function foo(options = {size: 'large', color: 'blue', speed: 'fast'}) {
    let { size, color } = options  ;
    console.log(size, color)
}

foo();

function foo({ a = 4, b = 5, c = 6 }) {
  console.log(a, b, c);
}

foo({
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  c: 3
});

foo({
  a: 1,
  c: 3
});
foo({});
```

## Concise Properties and Concise Methods 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#Method_definitions

```js
let foo = "24";
let bar = "foo";

var obj = {
  b() {},
  foo,
} 
```

## Computed Properties and Computed Methods

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#Computed_property_names

```js
let foo = "24";
let bar = "foo";

var obj = {
  ["my" + bar.toUpperCase()]() { console.log(this)},
  [bar.toUpperCase()]: 46,
} 
console.log(obj.FOO);
obj.myFOO();
```

## Symbols 

Symbols are a new data type. Symbols can be created and used as object properties. But the most useful are the built in symbols. They can used to change the default behavior of certain operations. 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol

* Symbol.iterator
* Symbol.toStringTag
* Symbol.toPrimitivehttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign
* Symbol.isConcatSpreadable

```js
let a = [1,2,3];
let it = a[Symbol.iterator]();
let x = it.next();
while (x.done === false) {
  console.log(x);
  x = it.next();
}

let b = {
  *[Symbol.iterator]() {
    for (let k in this ) {
      yield this[k];
    }
  },
  1: 1,
  2: 2,
  3: 3,
}

let a = [ ...b ];
console.log(a);
```

## For Of Loop 

The `for...of` loop can iterate over any iterable. 

[Mozilla For...Of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of)

```js
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let v of a )  {
  console.log(v);
}
```

## Generators 

Generating iterators. 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator

```js
let animals = {
  monkey: 1,
  horses: 3,
  cows: 4,
  sheep: 10,
  moose: 3
};

function* gen(obj) {
  for (let k in obj ) {
    yield `${obj[k]} ${k}`;
  }
}
let it = gen(animals);
let x = it.next()
while(x.value) {
  x = it.next();
  console.log(x)
}
```

## Array.find()

Returns the first matching element in an array. 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find

```js
let a = [..."isastringanarray"].find((el) => { return el === "a"});
console.log(a);
```

## Object.Assign

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign

The Object.assign method copies properties from one or more source objects to a target object
specified as the very first argument. This will take two objects and merge them in a 3rd object. Duplicate values from the rightmost object will override those to the left. You can have more than two objects. 

```js
let odd = {
  one: 1,
  thee: 3,
  five: 5
}

let even = {
  two: 2,
  four: 4,
  six: 6
}

let count = Object.assign({}, odd, even);
console.log(count);
```

## Maps

Use Maps when keys are unknown until runtime. Use Maps when all key are of the same type and all values are of the same type.  If there are mixed types use Objects. Maps are iterable.

> - The keys of an `Object` are [`Strings`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) and [`Symbols`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol), whereas they can be any value for a `Map`, including functions, objects, and any primitive.
> - The keys in Map are ordered while keys added to object are not. Thus, when iterating over it, a Map object returns keys in order of insertion.
> - You can get the size of a `Map` easily with the `size` property, while the number of properties in an `Object` must be determined manually.
> - A `Map` is an [iterable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/iterable) and can thus be directly iterated, whereas iterating over an `Object` requires obtaining its keys in some fashion and iterating over them.
> - An `Object` has a prototype, so there are default keys in the map that could collide with your keys if you're not careful. As of ES5 this can be bypassed by using `map = Object.create(null)`, but this is seldom done.
> - A `Map` may perform better in scenarios involving frequent addition and removal of key pairs.
>
> <cite>[Mozilla Maps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)</cite>

```js

let count = {
  one: 1,
  two: 2,
  thee: 3,
  four: 4,
  five: 5,
  six: 6
};

let map = new Map();
for (let k in count) {
  map.set(count[k], k);
}
console.log(count);
console.log(map);
```

## WeakMaps

WeekMaps keys must be objects, the values can be anything. 

> One difference to `Map` objects is that `WeakMap` keys are not enumerable (i.e., there is no method giving you a list of the keys). If they were, the list would depend on the state of garbage collection, introducing non-determinism.
>
> [Mozilla WeakMaps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Keyed_collections#WeakMap_object)

This makes WeakMaps useful for protecting private information. 

http://fitzgeraldnick.com/2014/01/13/hiding-implementation-details-with-e6-weakmaps.html

WeekMap keys may be garbage collected, also the values the keys reference may be garbage collected as well. This make them memory efficient. 

## Sets

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set

If a map is comparable to an object, then a set is comparable to an array. However, a value in a set must be unique. 

```js
let count = {
  one: 1,
  two: 2,
  thee: 3,
  four: 4,
  five: 5,
  six: 6
};

let set = new Set();
for (let k in count) {
  set.add(k);
}
set.delete("four");
console.log([...set.keys()]);
console.log(set);
```

## WeakSets

WeekSets are similar to week maps, they only store object. The objects are garbage collected. You cannot enumerate a WeekSet. A week set had three methods, `add`, `set`, and `delete`. 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakSet

## Classes 

Classes are syntactic sugar over JavaScript's prototype inheritance. 

> The `static` keyword defines a static method for a class. Static methods are called without [instantiating ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript#The_object_(class_instance))their class and **cannot** be called through a class instance. Static methods are often used to create utility functions for an application.
>
> [Mozilla Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

When a class extends another class. 

> If there is a constructor present in the subclass, it needs to first call super() before using "this".
>
> [Mozilla Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

```js
class Store {
  constructor(name, address) {
    this.name = name;
    this._address = address.toUpperCase();
  }
  get address() {
    return this._address;
  }

  set address(address) {
    this._address = address.toUpperCase();
  }
}

class Bakery extends Store {
  constructor(name, address, specialty) {
    super(name, address );
    this._specialty = specialty;
  }

  get specialty() {
    return this._specialty
  }
}

let goldenBuns = new Bakery("Golden Buns", "123 Wheat St", "Bread");

console.log(goldenBuns.address);
console.log(goldenBuns.specialty);
```

## Promises

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise

JavaScript is single threaded and thus synchronous by nature. Promises provide a mechanism for writing asynchronous code. 

```js
let url =
  "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise";

function requestURL(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("GET", url);
    xhr.onload = () => resolve(xhr.response);
    xhr.onerror = () => reject(xhr.statusText);
    xhr.send();
  });
}

requestURL(url)
  .then(results => {
    document.body.innerHTML = results;
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Then the page was updated.");
  })
  .finally(() => {
    console.log("Finally, it's over.");
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(`Error: ${error}`);
  });
```

## Modules 

>The **export** statement is used when creating JavaScript modules to export functions, objects, or primitive values from the module so they can be used by other programs with the [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) statement.
>
>Exported modules are in [`strict mode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) whether you declare them as such or not. The export statement cannot be used in embedded scripts.
>
>[Mozilla Export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export)

You cannot export default, variables defined with `var`, `let`, or `const` . 

```js
export default myFunction;
import myFunction from './myJsFile.js'
```

There are other module syntaxes in JavaScript. Node.js uses common.js modules. 

```js
const myFunction = require('myfunction');
```

You can read more about various  module syntaxes here: [ES6 Modules](http://2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html)
