I use a Linode sever as my 'devops box'. I have Jenkins installed via Docker with automatic SSL via Let's Encrypt and Traefik. CI is a nice thing to have ;). 



**About me:**

I'm a software engineer and I love programming the web. My background includes working with the LAMP stack on the backend and React/TypeScript on the frontend. I'm an AWS Certified Associate Solutions Architect.
