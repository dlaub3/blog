## About the site

This site is powered by Hugo and  Amazon Web Services.  It performs well and I'm proud of it.

I use a Linode sever as my 'devops box'. I have Jenkins installed via Docker with automatic SSL via Let's Encrypt and Traefik. CI is a nice thing to have ;). 

## About me

I'm a software engineer and I love programming the web. My background includes working with the LAMP stack on the backend and React/TypeScript on the frontend. I'm an AWS Certified Associate Solutions Architect.
