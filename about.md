I use a Linode sever as my 'devops box'. I have Jenkins installed via Docker with automatic SSL via Let's Encrypt and Traefik. CI is a nice thing to have ;). 



**About me:**

I'm a full stack web developer with a passion to learn. I enjoy JavaScript, Go, and Python, though I have the most professional experience with PHP and Perl. I'm a Linux and Docker lover.
